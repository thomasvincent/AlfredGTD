# Using AlfredGTD

This guide covers how to use the AlfredGTD workflow to implement the Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology effectively.

## GTD Quick Reference

AlfredGTD follows David Allen's GTD methodology with these key phases:

1. **Capture**: Collect what has your attention
2. **Clarify**: Process what it means
3. **Organize**: Put it where it belongs
4. **Reflect**: Review frequently
5. **Engage**: Take action

## Basic Commands

### Capturing Items

|---------|-------------|---------|
| `task [text]` | Add a task to your GTD inbox | `task Buy milk` |
| `note [text]` | Create a reference note | `note Ideas for presentation` |
| `project [text]` | Create a new project | `project Website redesign` |
